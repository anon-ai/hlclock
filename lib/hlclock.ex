  Hybrid Logical Clock

  Provides globally-unique, monotonic timestamps. Timestamps are bounded by the
  clock synchronization constraint, max_drift.

  Implementation assumes that timestamps are (at a minimum) regularly sent; a
  clock at rest will eventually be unable to generate timestamps due to assumed
  bounds on the logical clock relative to physical time.

  In order to account for physical time drift within the system, timestamps
  should regularly be exchanged between nodes. Generate a timestamp at one node
  via HLClock.send_timestamp/1; at the other node, call HLClock.recv_timestamp/2
  with the received timestamp from the first node.
